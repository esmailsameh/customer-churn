# Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to build a predictive model to identify whether a customer is likely to churn or stay, based on behavioral and demographic data.

By analyzing historical data and applying machine learning techniques, the model helps businesses detect at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.

## Techniques Used
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Logistic Regression

## Project Structure
- `Customer_churn.ipynb`: Full Jupyter notebook with all analysis steps
- `requirements.txt`: All dependencies used in the notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
